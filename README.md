1. Data Preparation
Load and inspect the data to ensure no missing values or anomalies.
Perform feature engineering by creating interaction terms and polynomial features, which may improve the modelâ€™s predictive capacity.
2. Feature Engineering and Scaling
Include additional features for non-linear relationships and scale the data to ensure consistent model performance.
3. Model Selection
Use Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, or an XGBoost Regressor, known for high accuracy and suitability for complex, structured data like this.
Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation will ensure the model is optimized for performance.
4. Implementation of Automated Insights
Set thresholds for optimal pressure and temperature ranges, letting the model predict adjustments to reduce pilot input.
